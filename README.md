The Calculator project we created today is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

HTML: Provides the structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers, operators (+, -, *, /), and a display area for showing the input and results.
CSS: Adds styling to make the calculator look neat and organized, with buttons arranged like a typical calculator.
JavaScript: Handles the logic behind the calculator, allowing users to click the buttons, perform calculations, and display the results on the screen.
This project is a practical example of how to build interactive applications using core web technologies.
